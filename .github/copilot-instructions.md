# GitHub Copilot Instructions for the Form Application

This document provides guidance for GitHub Copilot to assist in the development of this project, ensuring that generated code aligns with the architecture and technologies outlined in the `TechnicalSpecification.md`.

## General Principles

*   **Monolithic Architecture**: Remember that this is a monolithic application. The Spring Boot backend serves both the REST API and the React frontend. The frontend is packaged as a WebJar and included as a dependency in the backend.
*   **Follow Existing Patterns**: When generating code, please analyze the existing files to match the coding style, naming conventions, and architectural patterns.
*   **Adhere to Specifications**: All generated code should align with the `TechnicalSpecification.md` and `RequirementsSpecification.md`.

## Coding Conventions

### Java (Backend)
*   **Style Guide**: Follow the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
*   **Formatting**: Use Google Java Format for consistent code formatting.
*   **Naming**: Use clear and descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables (e.g., `FormService`, `getFormById`).
*   **Comments**: Do not add Javadoc comments.
*   **Immutability**: Prefer immutability where possible, especially for DTOs and configuration properties.
* Use lombok whenever possible.

### TypeScript/React (Frontend)
*   **Style Guide**: Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and the official TypeScript guidelines.
*   **Naming**:
    *   Use `PascalCase` for React components (e.g., `FormBuilderPage`) and classes (e.g., `FormService`).
    *   Use `camelCase` for variables, functions, and hooks (e.g., `useForm`, `fetchFormData`).
    * A base filename should exactly match the name of its default export.
*   **Components**: Always use functional components with hooks. Avoid class components.
*   **Variables**: Use `const` by default; use `let` only when a variable needs to be reassigned.
* Use useQuery and useMutation from react-query for data fetching and mutations.
* **Comments**: Use comments sparingly to explain complex logic, but avoid obvious comments.
* **Type Safety**: Always define types and interfaces for props, state, and API responses.
* **Styling**: Prefer using `react-bootstrap` components and utility classes over custom CSS.
* **Avoid any**: Do not use the `any` type; always strive for precise typing.
* **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for asynchronous operations, using try/catch blocks or error boundaries as appropriate.
* **Testing**: Write unit tests for components and hooks using React Testing Library and Vitest.
* **Accessibility**: Follow accessibility best practices, including using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes where necessary.
* **State Management**: Use React's built-in state management (useState, useContext) or libraries like Redux or Zustand for complex state needs.
* **API Integration**: Use Fetch API for making HTTP requests, and handle loading and error states appropriately.
* **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies up to date and avoid unnecessary packages to minimize bundle size.

## Backend (Java & Spring Boot)

The backend is a standard Spring Boot application.

*   **Stack**:
    *   **Language**: Java
    *   **Framework**: Spring Boot (using Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security)
    *   **Database**: PostgreSQL, H2 (for tests)
    *   **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with Spring Security and a development-time Spring Boot Authorization Server.

*   **Instructions**:
    *   **Entities**: Use standard JPA annotations (`@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, `@ManyToOne`, etc.).
    *   **Repositories**: For each entity, create a corresponding Spring Data JPA repository. It should extend `JpaRepository`.
    *   **Services**: Business logic should be placed in service. Use `@Service` and inject repositories.
    *   **Controllers**: Create REST controllers to expose API endpoints as defined in the technical specification. Use `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping("/api/...")`. Secure endpoints using Spring Security annotations (`@PreAuthorize`).
    *   **Testing**:
        *   For unit tests, use JUnit 5 and Mockito.
        *   For integration tests involving the database, use Spring Boot's test slices (`@DataJpaTest`) with an in-memory H2 database.
        *   For integration tests involving security, use `@SpringBootTest` and Testcontainers to provide an OAuth 2.0 authorization server.

## Frontend (TypeScript & React)

The frontend is a single-page application built with React and TypeScript.

*   **Stack**:
    *   **Language**: TypeScript
    *   **Framework**: React
    *   **Styling**: Bootstrap (via `react-bootstrap` components)
    *   **Build**: The project is located in the `frontend` module and is built by the `frontend-maven-plugin`.

*   **Instructions**:
    *   **Directory Structure**: Follow a standard React application structure within `frontend/src/`:
        *   `components/`: Reusable UI components.
            *   `common/`: Generic components like buttons, inputs, etc.
            *   `layout/`: Components that define the page structure (e.g., Header, Footer).
        *   `pages/`: Top-level components that correspond to a page/route (e.g., `HomePage`, `FormBuilderPage`).
        *   `hooks/`: Custom React hooks.
        *   `services/`: Functions for interacting with the backend API.
        *   `types/`: Shared TypeScript types and interfaces.
        *   `styles/`: Global styles or theme files.
    *   **Components**: Create functional components using React Hooks. Use `.tsx` for files containing JSX.
    *   **Styling**: Use `react-bootstrap` components (e.g., `<Button>`, `<Form>`, `<Container>`) for the UI. Avoid writing custom CSS where a Bootstrap component or utility class can be used.
    *   **State Management**: For simple component state, use `useState`. For more complex global state, consider using `useContext` with `useReducer`.
    *   **API Interaction**: Place API interaction logic in the `services/` directory. Use fetch for making requests.
    *   **Authentication**: The frontend should handle the OAuth 2.0 redirect flow. When making authenticated API calls, ensure the request includes the necessary credentials.

## Testing and Validation

A core principle of our development process is that the application must always be in a testable and verifiable state.

*   **Synchronize Tests with Code:** Any modification, refactoring, or addition of code must be accompanied by corresponding changes to the test suite.
*   **Definition of Done:** A task is not considered complete until all relevant tests pass and provide adequate coverage for the new or modified functionality. When you propose a plan, it must include steps for updating tests.
* Do not use should in test method names.

## Agent Profiles

The following agent profiles define specialized personas for different development tasks. Reference these when working on specific areas of the application.
